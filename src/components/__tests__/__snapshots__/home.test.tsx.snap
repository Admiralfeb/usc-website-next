          Established in 3306, the United Systems Cooperative is a tight-knit
            organization of independent pilots operating across the galaxy, both
            in human space, and the uncharted sectors beyond. Little is known
            about this groups motives and plans, though many conflicting reports
            are offered by systems across inhabited space. The one thing the
            reports agree on is that members of this group are fiercely loyal to
            one another, and to the organization as a whole. The United Systems
            Cooperative seeks to create a family where everyone is welcome, no
            matter their background, their allegiances, etc. To create a family
            where everyone can get the help they need, make lasting friendships,
            and have new brothers and sisters to fly with them through the
            black!
