## Advancements from 2020-12

- Next.JS - Updated from Create React App to Next.JS.
  - This allows systems like Facebook, Google, and Discord to properly scrape and embed the website from links.
  - It also minimizes project bundle sizes by generating the HTML for the static sites automatically during build time.
- Database connection update - As with the move to Next, it also presented a new option for connecting to our database and minimizing the project bundle size.
